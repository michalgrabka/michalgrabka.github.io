Under construction!

Game simulates evolution of dot objects. Dots main features:
- Dots gain health power by eating slowly growing "grass"
- Dots lose health power by time and as a cost of move
- Every dot has four genes affecting move speed and angle
- Dots move depends of amount of grass on field they collide

Evolutions' goal is to longer dots lifetime by manipulating speed and angle genes over generations. 

Currently evolution is turned off. Gene values are static.
